You can also download an ISO with the file from this challenge page.\n\n## Submission Format\nThe token you submit is a 32 character alpha-numeric string.\n\nExample submission:\n```\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456\n```\n\n## System and Tool Credentials\n| system/tool | username | password |\n|-------------|----------|----------|\n| Exploiter   | user     | tartans  |\n\n\n",


Is this on the test?\n\n## Background\n\nThe company \"Techstory\" was created one year ago and provides online photo storage, as well as a virtual photo book that can be shared with other users. You have been contracted as a penetration tester to evaluate their current environment and attempt to infiltrate their network.\n\nTechstory agreed to provide you with four packet capture files, each showing IP addresses within four different subnet blocks. These blocks are:\n\n* `192.168.58.[40-50]`\n* `192.168.132.[70-80]`\n* `192.168.176.[110-120]`\n* `192.168.210.[160-170]`\n\nBe advised, the packet captures are old and may not accurately portray the current network configuration. You should gather other information about the network and its systems to aid in your analysis. The company will be operating normally with a majority of workers unaware that penetration testing is taking place.\n\n## Getting started \nYou have access to a Kali Linux system with no network configuration applied. On its desktop will be a folder named `subnets` which contains the packet captures. You must determine any valid and unused IP addresses to assign to your Kali system. Afterwards, perform reconnaissance and gain access to a vulnerable machine on the network to view the flag.\n\n## Submission Format\nWhen entering your submissions, please enter them in the following format:\n1. Correct IP address configuration of Kali machine\n2. Host name of vulnerable machine \n3. Port accessed (number, not name) \n4. Flag string found on the vulnerable machine\n\nExample submission:\n\n**Part 1** \n```\n4.30.20.100\n```\n**Part 2**\n```\nDavid\n```\n**Part 3**\n```\n44\n```\n**Part 4**\n```\nLibrary\n```\n\n## System and Tool Credentials\n| system/tool | username | password |\n|-------------|----------|----------|\n| Kali      | user     | tartans  |\n\n\n",


Under Attack\n\n## Background\nSSH brute force attacks are a low-effort means for criminals to find accessible systems to use for nefarious purposes. They use dictionaries of common usernames, passwords, and default credentials\nand target huge swaths of the Internet looking for susceptible machines. \n\nYour incident response team has identified suspicious inbound SSH traffic. As an exploitation specialist, the team has asked you to modify the local ssh daemon in order to gain insight into the attacker's password library. This will help protect against similar attacks in the future.\n\n## Getting Started\nLog in to your Xubuntu workstation. In the `~/Downloads/` directory, there will be a .tar.gz file containing the ssh server software source code. Your\ntask is to modify, compile, and install a new daemon that logs, prints, stores, or otherwise saves the passwords\nprovided by the users attempting to connect to the system.\n\nIn a real world scenario, the attacker's password dictionary could consist of thousands of unique passwords. This\nexercise is different, and the attacker has a password dictionary with only one entry. Retrieve\nthe password to complete this challenge.\n\nYou will need root access to install your modified ssh daemon. Use `sudo su` to elevate to root privileges.\n\n## Submission Format\nThe submission for this challenge is an 8-byte value represented by 16 hexadecimal digits. All letters will be lower case.\n\nExample submission:\n```\nd0d0caca1337beef\n```\n\n## System Credentials\n| system      | username | password |\n|----------------|----------|----------|\n| ssh-xubuntu        | prescup     | tartans  |\n\n\n",


Some Assembly Required\n\n## Background\n\nDetecting malware by known signatures is a common practice. However, while signatures can be useful to protect\nagainst more basic threats, they only alert on known matches. In this challenge, you will need to defeat rudimentary signature\ndetection. There are **10** signatures being detected in this challenge. You must break at least **2** of these.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this challenge, the modified payload must retain at least **3** of its signatures.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nOn the desktop, in the **prescup-b5-r1** directory, there are three scripts:\n\n1. generate_raw_binary.sh\n2. assemble_payload.sh\n3. upload_file.sh\n\nOpen a terminal in this directory and run `generate_raw_binary.sh`. It will take 10-15 seconds, and then prompt for a `sudo` password. Enter the password listed below, and the file `asm_code.asm` will be generated.\n\nNext, modify `asm_code.asm` with modified or additional instructions as you see fit, in order to bypass detection.\n\nWhen you are done, run `assemble_payload.sh` to generate `payload.exe`. This command will also prompt for a `sudo`\npassword if it has been a while since running the first command.\n\nFinally, run `upload_file.sh`. If you've modified the assembly enough to break up a few signatures, you will receive\na flag. Otherwise, you will be told whether you have not broken enough signatures, or if you've broken too many of them.\n\n## Submission Format\n\nExample submission:\n\n```\n0123456789abcdef\n```\n\n## Systems and Tool Credentials\n| system/tool | username | password |\n|-------------|----------|----------|\n| sol-kali | user     | tartans  |\n\n\n",


Insider Insidiousness\n\n## Background\n  Your pentesting company has been asked by the Security Manager of Questron, Inc. to demonstrate the post-exploitation capabilities of an APT or an insider threat. With this, Questron's IT department and network security team can improve their detection abilities and overall security posture. \n\n## Getting Started\nYou have been given access to a Windows 10 host on the Questron network as a domain administrator. You must complete a series of tasks related to files in a shared directory on the machine named FS01.  Standard access to the file share has been disabled, so you should use remote queries to find the answer to each task question (WMI and/or PSRemoting are recommended tactics).\n\n## Questions\n\n1.\tWhich of the top-level directories in the Questron file share is a hidden directory?\n\n2.\tBased on the resources found under the Planning directory, name one of the Questron partner organizations.\n\n3.\tName the Questron project that is not named after a President (excluding the STONEHENGE project)? \n\n4.\tYou have been asked to identify information within the Project Charter of the STONEHENGE project. View the project documents and give the last name of the Project Lead. \n\n5.\tLocate an Excel spreadsheet containing a roster of Questron personnel. According to the roster, in what year did COO, Charles Lewis, begin working for Questron?  (_Hint,  this is a hidden file._)\n\n\n## Submission Format\nThe answer to the challenge is the token that you will find associated with each task that you are asked to perform.\n\n## Example submissions:\n\n**Question 1:** Directory Name\n```\nTheDirectory\n```\n\n**Question 2:** Partner Names\n```\nLastName\n```\n\n**Question 3:** Organization\n```\nTheOrg\n```\n\n**Question 4:** Project Lead\n```\nLastName\n```\n\n**Question 5:** Year\n```\n2020\n```\n\n  ## System and Tool Credentials\n  |  system/tool  | username | password |\n  |---------------|----------|----------|\n  | win10-desktop | aferguson   | tartans|\n  \n\n",
